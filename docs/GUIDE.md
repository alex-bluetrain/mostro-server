# Mostro server — setup & operations guide

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/agents.png" alt="Mostro"/>
</p>

A family-care assistant for recurring orders — diapers, medications, and refunds — reachable from Telegram, Discord, and the [mostro-app](https://github.com/alex-bluetrain/mostro-app) web/Android client. Built with [Mastra](https://mastra.ai/).

A single **supervisor agent** handles every channel. Only its core tools are pinned; domain tools are discovered on demand via tool search and guided by per-domain skills. Each order runs as a workflow with **suspend/resume semantics** — it pauses until Mostro's own mailbox-polling cycle finds and matches the supplier's reply, then notifies subscribed users.

## Features

- **One supervisor, discoverable tools** — `subscribe` and `setMyName` are pinned; everything else (orders, status, invites, Discord linking, weather) is found via `search_tools`, so context cost doesn't grow with the catalog
- **Invite-only access** — canonical user identity keyed by Google email; unknown senders are silently ignored, admins invite people via one-time deep links (see [identity.md](identity.md))
- **Google bearer auth for the app** — clients send Google's `id_token`; the server verifies it against JWKS and authorizes it against the same users collection as the bot
- **Generative UI** — the app streams AG-UI events from `/agents/mostro-supervisor/openui` and renders OpenUI Lang responses
- **Suspend/resume workflows** — long-running order flows that halt at a step until a matching reply is found in Mostro's own mailbox
- **Mailbox polling** — a scheduled workflow per domain reads Mostro's Gmail inbox every 15 minutes, matches replies to the suspended step of the run they belong to, and resumes it — see [Mailbox Polling](#mailbox-polling) below
- **Outbound email** — orders reach suppliers as real emails sent from Mostro's own Gmail account, so replies land in its inbox; a send that fails leaves the order un-placed and retryable rather than silently marked as sent
- **Notification subscriptions** — users subscribe to order updates and get a message when events occur
- **Monthly scoping** — one shared order per domain per month (deterministic run IDs like `diapers-2025-07`)
- **Ngrok tunneling** — optional tunnel for Telegram's webhook delivery in local development (skipped in production, where the bot is reachable on a public domain — see [Deployment](#deployment))

### Agents

| Agent                 | Description                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mostro Supervisor** | Single entry point for every channel. Pinned core tools + on-demand domain tools (`ToolSearchProcessor`) and skills       |
| **Inbox Classifier**  | Used by the poll workflows to classify supplier replies and extract data against the rules stored in MongoDB             |

### Workflows

Each domain workflow follows a request → wait → notify pattern with mailbox-polling-driven resume points:

- **Diapers**: `requested → date_confirmed → notification_sent`
- **Meds**: `requested → acknowledged → ack_notified → delivery_confirmed → notification_sent`
- **Refunds**: `requested → acknowledged → ack_notified → confirmed → confirmation_notified → deposit_received → deposit_confirmed → notification_sent`

### Mailbox Polling

There is no inbound webhook for suppliers to call. Instead, one poll workflow per domain
(`diapers-poll`, `meds-poll`, `refunds-poll`) runs on a 15-minute Mastra `schedule`. Each cycle
orchestrates three independent modules:

1. **`inbox-manager`** (`src/mastra/lib/inbox-manager/`) — the only module that talks to Gmail.
   Translates a natural-language query description into Gmail search syntax once, fetches
   unprocessed replies (anything without an `outcome.*` status label), and applies labels.
2. **`mail-classifier`** (`src/mastra/lib/mail-classifier/`) — classifies each mail and extracts
   structured data via LLM, driven by **versioned classification rules stored in MongoDB**, read
   fresh on every cycle — publish a new rules snapshot and the next cycle picks it up, no redeploy.
3. **`outcome-processor`** (`src/mastra/lib/outcome-processor/`) — runs the side effect registered
   in code for the classified label (resuming the matching suspended workflow run).

Every processed mail ends up with two orthogonal labels: what it is (e.g. `diapers.confirmed`,
from the MongoDB rules) and how processing went (`outcome.completed` / `outcome.failed` /
`outcome.review`). Mails without a status label are picked up again on the next cycle
(at-least-once semantics).

Classification rules are seeded from JSON files kept **outside the repo** (they contain sensitive
data): `pnpm seed:classifier -- --domain <domain> --file <path> --author <name> --changelog <text>`.

See [docs/inbox-pipeline.md](inbox-pipeline.md) for the full architecture — module
responsibilities, label semantics, MongoDB snapshot versioning, orchestration, and operational
notes — and [docs/clasificador.md](clasificador.md) for the rules JSON format.

The three poll workflows still run every 15 minutes each, but on offset minutes
(`diapers-poll` at `2,17,32,47`, `meds-poll` at `7,22,37,52`, `refunds-poll` at `12,27,42,57`) so
the three domains don't hit the Gmail API at the same instant.

**When upgrading an already-deployed instance**, re-run `pnpm gmail:auth`. An existing refresh
token minted before polling only carries the `gmail.send` scope; the pollers need `gmail.modify`
to read replies and apply labels. Without the new scope the poller gets a 403 every 15 minutes.

## Tech Stack

- **[Mastra](https://mastra.ai/)** — AI agent framework (agents, workflows, tools, memory, observability)
- **[DeepSeek v4 Flash](https://deepseek.com/)** via OpenRouter — LLM provider
- **[@chat-adapter/telegram](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chat-adapter/telegram)** / **[@chat-adapter/discord](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chat-adapter/discord)** — chat channels
- **[@ag-ui/mastra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ag-ui/mastra)** — AG-UI event stream for the app
- **MongoDB** — workflow state, agent memory, users, invites, and classification rules
- **DuckDB** — observability and tracing
- **ngrok** — tunnel for Telegram's webhook delivery
- **Zod** — schema validation
- **[Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api)** via `@googleapis/gmail` — sends outbound emails

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22.13.0
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API key
- A [Telegram Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) token
- Optional: an [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account with a reserved domain, only if you want Telegram to deliver webhooks to your local server (otherwise the bot long-polls)
- A Gmail account for Mostro itself — outbound orders are sent from it, and suppliers reply to it
- A Google Cloud project with the Gmail API enabled, an OAuth client, and the app published to
  production (see the one-time setup in step 3 below)
- Optional, for app login: a Google OAuth client for sign-in (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`) — the same project can
  host it

### One project, two OAuth clients

Sending mail and logging in are separate integrations with separate credentials
(`GMAIL_MAILER_*` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`), but they can live in one Google Cloud
project.

Users logging in are never asked for Gmail access. Consent is granted per authorization request,
not per project: the login asks for `openid email profile`, while `gmail.send` is requested once,
by you, when you authorize the mailer with Mostro's own account.

What the two do share, being one project: the 100-new-user cap Google applies to an app that has
shown the "unverified app" screen — which the mailer will, since its scope is sensitive and the app
is published but unverified — plus the verification paperwork if you ever need it, and the blast
radius of a suspension. None of that binds at family scale. Split the mailer into its own project
if you ever open the login to people outside the household.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alex-bluetrain/mostro-server.git
   cd mostro-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Copy the environment file and fill in your values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
   TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
   TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN=
   MONGODB_URI=
   MONGODB_DB_NAME=
   NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=
   NGROK_DOMAIN=
   NGROK_FORWARD_ADDR=
   ADMIN_EMAIL=
   ADMIN_NAME=
   ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID=
   ```

   `ADMIN_EMAIL` seeds the first authorized user on boot — without it nobody can talk to the bot or log into the app. See [docs/identity.md](identity.md) for how identity and invites work. Note: most optional variables must be absent, not empty — an empty value fails zod validation and aborts the boot (the `NGROK_*` and `DEV_CORS_ORIGINS` variables are the exception: empty is treated as unset).

   **Telegram in local dev.** By default the bot long-polls, so no tunnel is needed. ngrok is only for testing webhook delivery: the tunnel opens when `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` **and** `NGROK_FORWARD_ADDR` are set (point it at this server: `localhost:4111` under `pnpm dev`, `mostro-server:4111` under docker compose). The tunnel does not register the webhook: call Telegram's `setWebhook` with `https://<NGROK_DOMAIN>/api/agents/mostro-supervisor/channels/telegram/webhook` and `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN` as `secret_token`. While a webhook is registered the adapter uses it on every boot; call `deleteWebhook` to go back to polling. Never do this with the production bot token.

   App access — Google's OAuth client ID. Clients (mostro-app on Android/web) send Google's
   `id_token` as a bearer; the server verifies it against JWKS. A valid token is not enough: the
   email must exist in `users`, so access stays invite-only:

   ```env
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
   ```

   Admin access to Studio (min 32 chars) — enables `SimpleAuth`, which is exempt from Studio's EE
   license gate, so a local Studio can connect to production. Used in prod (via Infisical). See
   [docs/studio-prod.md](studio-prod.md):

   ```env
   STUDIO_API_KEY=
   ```

   Both are individually optional, but **at least one must be set**: with no auth provider the
   server would be wide open, so the boot fails instead.

   Optional — bootstrap for the classification rules, one minified JSON per domain. On boot the
   server publishes them as the initial snapshot **only for domains that have no active pointer
   yet**; a domain already seeded is never overwritten. Used in prod (via Infisical) so a fresh
   database can't leave the poll workflows failing every cycle. See
   [docs/classifier-rules/](classifier-rules/):

   ```env
   CLASSIFIER_RULES_DIAPERS=
   CLASSIFIER_RULES_MEDS=
   CLASSIFIER_RULES_REFUNDS=
   ```

   Required — Gmail, for sending outbound emails and for the poll workflows that read replies
   back from the same inbox:

   ```env
   GMAIL_MAILER_CLIENT_ID=
   GMAIL_MAILER_CLIENT_SECRET=
   GMAIL_MAILER_REFRESH_TOKEN=
   GMAIL_MAILER_SENDER=
   DIAPERS_EMAIL_TO=
   MEDS_EMAIL_TO=
   REFUNDS_EMAIL_TO=
   ```

   One-time Gmail account setup:

   1. Create a Google Cloud project — the same one can also host the app login's OAuth client.
   2. Enable the Gmail API.
   3. Create an OAuth client of type "Web application", **separate from the login one**, with a
      redirect to `http://127.0.0.1:53682/oauth2callback`. Google matches redirect URIs literally,
      so scheme, host, port and trailing slash must be exactly that — in particular `127.0.0.1`
      and not `localhost`, which on Windows resolves to IPv6 first while the script listens on
      IPv4. ("Web application" rather than "Desktop app" because the client secret lives in a
      server's `.env` and is treated as confidential.)
   4. Add the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` and
      `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` scopes. Sending only needs `gmail.send`;
      `gmail.modify` is what lets the poll workflows read replies and apply the classification and
      status labels (e.g. `diapers.confirmed`, `outcome.completed`). Gmail doesn't offer a scope
      narrower than "the whole mailbox" — the poller's containment is in code (a per-domain query
      description, fixed resume functions per outcome), not in the OAuth grant.
   5. **Publish the app to production.** In _Testing_ mode the refresh token is invalidated
      after 7 days and sends (and polling) start failing. Authorizing shows the "unverified app"
      screen, which you accept manually.
   6. Run `pnpm gmail:auth` with the Mostro account and save the token in `.env`.

   `gmail:auth` runs as its own process and briefly listens on port 53682 — not Mastra's port,
   which it would collide with while `pnpm dev` is up. The callback cannot be a Mastra route
   either: `GMAIL_MAILER_REFRESH_TOKEN` is required for the server to boot, so you would need the
   token to start the thing that gives you the token. The port number itself is arbitrary; it only
   has to match the redirect URI registered on the OAuth client.

   The consent screen's user type must be **External** — _Internal_ only exists for Google
   Workspace organizations, and Mostro's account is a plain `@gmail.com` one. Publishing the app
   is not the same as getting it verified: you can publish without verification, and authorizing
   then shows the "Google hasn't verified this app" screen, which you accept manually.

   The refresh token also dies if the Mostro account's **password changes** (Google invalidates
   tokens carrying Gmail scopes) or if it goes **six months unused**. In all of these cases sends
   fail with `invalid_grant`, and the mailer's error message says so — the fix is always to re-run
   `pnpm gmail:auth`.

4. Seed the classification rules (once per domain, and again whenever the rules change):

   ```bash
   pnpm seed:classifier -- --domain diapers --file <path-to-rules.json> --author "you" --changelog "initial seed"
   ```

   The rules JSON lives outside the repo (it contains sensitive supplier data). Start from the
   per-domain templates in [docs/classifier-rules/](classifier-rules/) — labels and extract
   schemas already match the code — and fill in the `<...>` placeholders. Without a seeded
   snapshot for a domain, that domain's poll cycle fails fast with a clear error. Format:
   [docs/clasificador.md](clasificador.md).

   You can skip this step by putting the same JSON, minified, in `CLASSIFIER_RULES_<DOMAIN>`:
   the server seeds any domain that has no active pointer on boot, and logs a loud error for the
   ones it can't. The script stays the way to publish *new* versions of rules that are already
   seeded.

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   This starts the Mastra dev server with [Mastra Studio](https://mastra.ai/docs/studio/overview) at `http://localhost:4111`.

## Deployment

Production runs on a GCP `e2-micro` VM (free tier) as a Docker container behind Caddy, reachable
over HTTPS on a DuckDNS domain. The infrastructure (VM, Caddy, Infisical) is managed outside
this repo.

This repo owns **versioning and image publishing**:

1. Merge to `main` using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`,
   `fix:`). Anything else (`chore:`, `docs:`) doesn't produce a release.
2. `release.yml` keeps a **Release PR** open with the accumulated changelog. Merging it tags
   `vX.Y.Z` and publishes the image to `ghcr.io/alex-bluetrain/mostro-server` (`:vX.Y.Z` and `:latest`).
3. Deploying is a deliberate, separate step: run the **Deploy** workflow with `version=vX.Y.Z`.
   It checks the tag exists in the registry before touching the VM, then waits for the container's
   health check. Rolling back is the same workflow with an older tag.

Secrets are **not** baked into the image and don't live in this repo: the container authenticates
to Infisical at startup with the VM's GCE identity and holds the secrets in memory only. That means
production has no `.env` — the file above is for local development.

### Studio against production

Studio is served by the production server itself at the root of the production domain
(`https://<PROD_DOMAIN>/`) — log in with any email and the `STUDIO_API_KEY` as the password.

Two things make that work. Studio authenticates with `SimpleAuth` (an API key via
`STUDIO_API_KEY`), because Studio's login UI with third-party auth providers in production is
gated behind a Mastra Enterprise Edition license — `SimpleAuth` is exempt. And the
image is built with `mastra build --studio`, so Studio and the API share one origin: the session
cookie is `SameSite=Lax`, which browsers refuse to send cross-site. See
[docs/studio-prod.md](studio-prod.md) for the full story.

`ngrok` is local-only. In production `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` is absent, so the tunnel is never opened and
Telegram reaches the bot through the public domain instead.

### Logs

Everything Mastra logs — plus any `logger.*` call from a workflow or tool — goes through a
`PinoLogger` built in [`src/mastra/lib/app-logger.ts`](../src/mastra/lib/app-logger.ts). By default that
means stdout: the terminal in development, `docker logs` on the VM.

Setting `AXIOM_TOKEN` **and** `AXIOM_DATASET` adds [Axiom](https://axiom.co/) as a second
destination. Pino writes to both streams, so shipping logs never removes them from the console, and
if either variable is missing the boot warns once and keeps the local-only behaviour. The Axiom
transport batches and retries on its own, so an unreachable or misconfigured Axiom never takes the
server down.

Use an Axiom API token scoped to ingest on that one dataset, and load it through Infisical like the
rest of the production secrets.

Note that `console.*` calls (the `[poll-*]`, `[classifier-seed]` and `[telegram-start]` messages)
bypass Pino entirely, so they only reach `docker logs`, not Axiom.

## Known limitations / TODO

- **Phase 2: SSO / cookie flow not implemented.** The cookie-based SSO flow (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
  and `GOOGLE_COOKIE_PASSWORD`) is not wired up. Current auth is Bearer id_token only. SSO would enable persistent web
  sessions and silent re-auth for the Expo web client.
